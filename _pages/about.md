>“In God we trust, others must provide data.” - W. Edwards Deming

My name is Maximilian Staebler, I am 25 years old and study Data Science at the University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt (Master). Currently I am doing an Erasmus semester abroad at the TU Dublin. When I am not looking for errors on Stackoverflow I like to do sports and travel all over the world.

This page contains projects that I have realized in a university context or in my spare time. In the big landscape of Data Science I am most enthusiastic about **Time Series Analysis**, **Urban Data Science (Geo-Data Analysis)** and **Data Visualization**. Therefore these topics are of course more represented than others.

If you have any questions about projects or comments on the results achieved, please do not hesitate to contact me: [Mail](mailto:maximilianstaebler@icloud.com)
